# Fantasy-Premier-League-Dashboard

> This project started during 2020 when the pandemic hit and I was trying to focus on how I go about the decision making process of choosing a fantasy premier league team. Check out this [article](https://lexmankumar.medium.com/my-experiment-with-fantasy-premier-league-20-21-part-1-486a840878dc) to know more. 

This repository contains the base python code to create a dataset in a pre-decided format and the tableau dashboard that takes it as an input. The dashboard title is updated to reflect 21/22 season. 

I am planning to build this iteratively. I am interested in collaborating with like-minded folks. You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexmankumar). Feel free to ping me if you would like to discuss potential ways in which this can be made better or anything for that matter.
